Using the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx insert a new VBA module and copy the complete VBA script from vba_stockticker_complete.vbs. Running this code will insert several new columns that compare the opening and closing price by stock ticker for each year. There is a separate tab/worksheet for each year.

To run the VBA code for just the main part of the homework, use the file vba_stockticker_main.vbs.

To run the VBA code for just the bonus part of the homework, use the file vba_stockticker_bonus.vbs.

In addition to the opening and closing stock price by ticker by year, there are additional columns created for the bonus section of the homework. These additional columns will loop through the opening and closing prices by ticker to identify which ticker had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease as well as the greatest overall volume.

When the VBA script is finished, a message box will display to the user alerting them the calculations are complete. 

There are screen prints from the completed files for each year: screenPrint_2014.jpeg, screenPrint_2015.jpeg, and screenPrint_2016.jpeg.
